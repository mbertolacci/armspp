## Resubmission

This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Single quoted the package name Rcpp in the DESCRIPTION Title and Description
* Elaborated in the package Description.
* Added a reference with doi to the package Description. win-builder suggests this might be incorrect (error 403), but I have confirmed it is correct.
* (NOT BASED ON REJECTION COMMENTS) I noticed that I had included an incomplete vignette with the original submission. I have added minimal extra detail to make this actually useful.

## Test environments

* local OS X install, R 3.5.3
* ubuntu 14.04.5 LTS (on travis-ci), R 3.5.2
* win-builder (devel and release)

## R CMD check results

There were no ERRORs, WARNINGs or NOTEs (excepting the first submission NOTE).
